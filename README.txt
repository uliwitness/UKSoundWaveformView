UKSOUNDWAVEFORMVIEW

A little view that takes a sound file and displays a waveform illustrating its contents.


IMPORTANT!

You *must* check out UliKit into a folder next to this one, or it will not find some needed files.

The example app looks for a file named testsound.aiff in your home directory to display.
